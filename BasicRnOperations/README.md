# Shortest Distance

The subspace W is defined as the span of $u_1$ and $u_2$ ($W$ = Span{$u_1$, $u_2$}).
The coordinate of a point $y$ (which doesnâ€™t lie on $W$) is given by the vector $y = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ -5 \\ 10 \end{bmatrix}$. Find the shortest distance from $y$ to  $W$ if $u_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ and $u_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$.
