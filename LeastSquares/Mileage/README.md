## Mileage

Numerous factors affect cars’ gasoline mileage. In this problem we’ll consider the relationship between gasoline mileage (mpg) and engine displacement (liters).  
  
1. Use the data in `mileage.csv`to
create a linear regression model mileage = beta_0 + beta_1 * 1 / sqrt(disp)$. Report the model parameters.
1. Use your model to predict the mpg of a car whose engine
displacement is 1.8 liters.
