# Least Squares

## Football

Now that football season is upon us, letâ€™s put Linear Algebra to good use! `rating.csv` file
presents quarterback ratings for the 2008 NFL season (The Sports Network).

1. Create a Least Square model to relate the dependent variable quarterback rating to the percentage of
completions (Pct Comp).
1. Create a Least Square model to relate the dependent variable quarterback rating to the percentage of
Completions (Pct Comp) and interceptions. (Pct Int)
1. Determine the least square error (square root of sum of square errors) for models in part a and b. Does
using an extra variable, namely percentage of interceptions, improve the accuracy of the model for this
data set? Comment.
1. Use your models in part a and b to predict the rating for a quarterback with percentage of completions
of 60%, and percentage of interceptions of 3%.
